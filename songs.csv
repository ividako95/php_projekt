M;Brandenburg Gate;I would cut my legs and tits off When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski In the dark of the moon  It made me dream of Nosferatu Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau Oh wouldn’t it be lovely  I was thinking Peter Lorre When things got pretty gory as I Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate  I was feeling snappy perhaps I’d been napping And I’d just ate A following heart can tear you apart On a midnight to 8 shift  A graveyard romance can only give one chance As the tombstones weave and breathe  Feeling happy when my heart got beating On a Sunday afternoon  I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses And stars were still illumed I have three hearts that I keep apart Trying to relate To normal feelings and the nightime reelings And some absynthe drunk so late  The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk Onto the size of dessert plates But me I’m happy cause I got my little nappy And some opium to set me straight I’m just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl While my looks still hold me straight  Straight up to illusion and fantasy’s fusion Of reality mixed with drink I’m just a small town girl who’s gonna give life a whirl Looking at the Brandenburg Gate

N;Curmudgeon;I can't hide, no On the mantle I'm not sad Until I'm home  It's the season I'm all reason I have seen All I have grown  Sheared at the seams Cheat on me And not seen At the seams  I'm a lender I'm a planter I put something In the garden  In the handle On the mantle I met Santa I met God  I'm a lady Can you save me? It's the sulfur I have grown  'Tis the season I'm all reason I have fleas So run on home  
N;Come As You Are;Come as you are, as you were As I want you to be As a friend, as a friend As a known enemy  Take your time, hurry up Choice is yours, don't be late Take a rest as a friend As an old  Memoria, memoria Memoria, memoria  Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach As I want you to be As a trend, as a friend As an old  Memoria, memoria Memoria, memoria  When I swear that I don't have a gun No I don't have a gun No I don't have a gun  Memoria, memoria Memoria, memoria (And I don't have a gun)  When I swear that I don't have a gun No I don't have a gun No I don't have a gun No I don't have a gun No I don't have a gun  Memoria, memoria 
M;One;I can’t remember anything Can’t tell if this is true or dream Deep down inside I feel the scream This terrible silence stops me  Now that the war is through with me I’m waking up, I cannot see That there’s not much left of me Nothing is real but pain now  Hold my breath as I wish for death Oh please, God, wake me  Back in the womb it’s much too real In pumps life that I must feel But can’t look forward to reveal Look to the time when I’ll live  Fed through the tube that sticks in me Just like a wartime novelty Tied to machines that make me be Cut this life off from me  Hold my breath as I wish for death Oh please, God, wake me  Now the world is gone, I’m just one Oh God, help me Hold my breath as I wish for death Oh please, God, help me  Darkness Imprisoning me All that I see Absolute horror I cannot live I cannot die Trapped in myself Body my holding cell  Landmine Has taken my sight Taken my speech Taken my hearing Taken my arms Taken my legs Taken my soul Left me with life in hell 
M;Now That We're Dead;When darkness falls May it be That we should see the light  When reaper calls May it be That we walk straight and right  When doubt returns May it be That faith shall permeate our scars  When we're seduced Then may it be That we not deviate our cause  All sinners, a future All saints, a past Beginning, the ending Return to ash  Now that we're dead, my dear We can be together Now that we're dead, my dear We can live forever  When all is pain May it be It's all we've ever known  When flame consumes May it be It warms our dying bones  When loss has won May it be It's you I'm madly fighting for  When Kingdom comes May it be We walk right through that open door  All sinners, a future All saints, a past Beginning, the ending Return to ash  Now that we're dead, my dear We can be together Now that we're dead, my dear We can live forever  All sinners, a future All saints, a past Beginning, the ending Return to ash  Now that we're dead, my dear We can be together Now that we're dead, my dear We can live, we can live forever  Return to ashes, shed this skin Beyond the black, we rise again We shall live forever
